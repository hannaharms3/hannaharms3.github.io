      <h2>Research</h2>


      <article class="research">
          <p>As a student within the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami, there are many opportunities to participate in hands-on research and outreach activities that advance ocean conservation and scientific literacy.  As an undergraduate in the program, a track in Marine Affairs and Policy has allowed me to become engaged in an ongoing (and thrilling) shark tagging and conservation project, and has continuously prepared me for both past and future experiences and careers in marine science-based research, policy, conservation and related fields.</p>

        <h3>RJ Dunlap Marine Conservation Program (Miami, FL)</h3>
         

        <p>The RJ Dunlap Marine Conservation Program (RJD) is a joint initiative of the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy.  The program's mission is to "advance ocean conservation and scientific literacy by conducting cutting edge scientific research and providing innovative and meaningful outreach opportunities for students through exhilarating hands-on research and virtual learning experiences in marine biology."  The program is instrumental in teaching local youth as well as other "citizen scientists" about shark and ocean conservation.</p>
        <p>As an RJD intern, I attend and participate in scheduled shark research/outreach trips, as well as training sessions and lab meetings.  Additionally, I contribute to the online blog by writing trip summaries, an entry breaking down and summarizing an ocean-related scientific publication, and an extended entry about a marine conservation topic of choice.</p>

        <h3>New England Aquarium (Boston, MA)</h3>

        
        <p>The New England Aquarium, located in Boston, Massachusetts, is constantly redefining what it means to be an aquarium.  By combining "education, entertainment and action to address the most challenging problems facing the ocean," the New England Aquarium is quite unique.  With an array of educational programs and conservation research and initiatives, the aquarium is the leader in ocean exploration and marine conservation.</p>
        <p>As both a Freshwater Gallery Aquarist Intern and a Wet Lab/Edge of the Sea Exhibit Aquarist Intern, I acquired basic husbandry skills, including feeding of fish, frogs and snakes.  In addition, I maintained aquarium systems, and completed other routine duties such as siphoning and cleaning tanks, changing filters, collecting animals, and taking and recording temperatures, water changes and other projects.  I was a critical participant to the daily success of the aquarium's mission, which aims to incorporate hands-on programs, live animal and interactive exhibits, public lectures and forums, and research and conservation projects to protect the world's oceans.</p>
        <p>In addition to the daily aquarist routines, I became engaged in Project Piaba, a "community-based interdisciplinary project established to understand the ecological and socio-cultural systems of the middle Rio Negro basin, Amazon, Brazil, in order to conserve and maintain the live ornamental fishery and other renewable resources at commercially feasible and ecologically sustainable levels."</p>

         <h3>The School for Field Studies (South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands)</h3>
         
        <p>The School for Field Studies creates study abroad experiences through field-based learning and research. One of their many field stations is located on the small island of South Caicos, where researchers and professors gear research toward management techniques and policies of Marine Protected Areas surrounding the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
        <p>As a student in this program, I learned about pollution and increased extraction of marine resources; unsustainable tourism; industrial development and its negative impact on the Turks and Caicos pristine marine ecosystem.  My project focused on the effectiveness of marine protected areas in defending biodiversity and critical habitats, enhancing stocks of queen conch and spiny lobster, and contributing effectively to the socioeconomic sustainability of the local community.  By comparing the density of herbivorous fish both inside and outside of the marine protected area, we effectively reached the goal of collecting data from the field in order to influence policy recommendations, marine protected area management plans, and community projects.</p>

        <h3>The Island School and Cape Eleuthera Institute (Eleuthera, Bahamas)</h3>

        <p>As a research student at the Island School and Cape Eleuthera Institute in the Bahamas,  I attended classes focused on the local marine environment, as well as coastal sustainability and marine ecology as it applies to global problems occurring in and around the world's oceans.  Daily activities included: SCUBA diving, island exploration, shark and Lionfish dissections, instructing local youth, kayaking to complement some of the field work, and campus work to encourage and development leadership and teamwork skills.</p>
