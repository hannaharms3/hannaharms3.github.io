        <p>Welcome to my portfolio.  My name is Hannah Armstrong and I am currently a senior undergraduate student within the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami, located in Coral Gables, Florida.</p>
        
        <p>I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Marine Affairs and Policy, as well as minors in Ecosystem Science and Policy and Visual Journalism, in the month of May, 2014.  In the fall of 2014, I will begin seeking a Masters of Professional Science (MPS) degree with a concentration in Marine Conservation, also from the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.</p>
        
        <p>I have participated in numerous oceanic research projects in and around the Caribbean, as well as South Florida, working with turtles, Lionfish, and most recently sharks.</p>

        <p>Aside from my involvement in the marine sciences, I enjoy using graphic design and photography as a means of conveying issues that are problematic for, and related to, the world's oceans.  Additionally I enjoy playing intramural sports, cooking and SCUBA diving.</p>
