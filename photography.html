      <article class="photography">
        <p>I have enjoyed all aspects of photography and have been taking pictures for as long as I can remember.  Throughout middle and high school I began delving into the field with black and white prints produced in a dark room.  As my interest in the field continued to grow, I began experimenting with digital photography, grasping the basic concepts surrounding aperture and shutter speed.  Most recently I have been completing assignments in the realm of "documentary photography", a form of photography aimed at telling stories, historical accounts and the like.  My true passion lies in the field of underwater photography.</p>
